This project is currently just a doodle.

The current plan is:
M1-1. Implement good physics for circle/circle case.
M1-2. Implement good physics for circle/line case (lasers!).
M1-3. Implement triangle and recursive subdivision into hierarchy of circles.
M1-4. Implement complex objects composed of a hierarchy of triangles.
M1-5. Implement collisions between composite objects.
M1-6. Implement multiple LOD collsions.
At this point we should have a reasonably efficient 2d physics engine

M2-1. Implement a larger world than the visible viewport.
M2-2. Add planets (with gravity wells).

TODO:
particle system
projectiles
lasers
damage system
planet landing
space stations?
asteroids showers
